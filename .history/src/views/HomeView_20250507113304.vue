        I’m a creative software developer who balances clean code with a messy sketchbook. By day, I craft reliable, efficient solutions; by night, I dive into illustration, storytelling, and music. Driven by curiosity and discipline, I believe coding isn’t just about tech — it’s about building freedom for artistic dreams. Whether I’m developing sleek applications or sketching wild characters for my daughters’ stories, I bring energy, precision, and imagination to everything I create. Let’s build something remarkable together.
